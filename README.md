This is a learning project just to play around with and learn more about https://textual.textualize.io


Anyone is welcome to use this, but I would not consider it to be in distributable form at all.   

Notes: 
* I haven't put any time into making the layout work well when resizing, so there are a decent amount of magic values
* Turns out this is a little annoying to test, since it sort of depends on the actual games.  I could record the responses to play back, but that feels like way too much work for just playing around.
